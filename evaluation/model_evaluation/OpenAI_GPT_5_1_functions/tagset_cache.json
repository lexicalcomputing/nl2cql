{"preloaded/ententen21_tt31": "general context\n----------------\n- Corpus language: English.\n- POS annotation tool: TreeTagger with Sketch Engine modifications (current pipeline version 3).\n- Tagset is a modified TreeTagger tagset, itself related to the Penn Treebank tagset.\n- Main structural differences from Penn:\n  - All non-modal verbs are split into:\n    - VB* = forms of \u201cbe\u201d\n    - VH* = forms of \u201chave\u201d\n    - VV* = all other (non-modal) lexical verbs\n  - Proper nouns:\n    - Penn\u2019s NNP \u2192 NP (proper noun, singular)\n    - Penn\u2019s NNPS \u2192 NPS (proper noun, plural)\n  - SENT is used for sentence-final punctuation (. ! ?).\n- Token \u201cto\u201d:\n  - Tagged IN when used as a preposition.\n  - Tagged TO only when used as an infinitive marker.\n- Indefinite articles:\n  - \u201ca\u201d and \u201can\u201d are both lemmatized as \u201ca\u201d.\n- Possessive clitics and numerals:\n  - Possessive clitic (\u2019s / \u2019) is re-tokenized and (almost always) joined to the preceding word.\n  - Old tags POS, PP$, WP$ are replaced by:\n    - Z (standalone possessive ending)\n    - PPZ (possessive pronoun)\n    - WPZ (possessive wh-pronoun)\n  - New possessive tags: NNZ, NNSZ, NPZ, NPSZ, CDZ (possessive forms of nouns, proper nouns, numerals).\n- Tokenization and other processing:\n  - Updated models improve lemma guessing for possessives.\n  - Tokenizer recognizes hashtags, user handles, emojis.\n  - Improved sentence boundary detection around quotation marks.\n  - Lemma for \u201cwould\u201d is \u201cwould\u201d (no stem reduction).\n\n\nhow CQL with tagset should be written\n-------------------------------------\n- POS tags are accessed in CQL via the attribute tag.\n- Basic form: [tag=\"TAG\"] where TAG is an exact tag string, e.g. [tag=\"NNS\"].\n- Tags must be written as:\n  - exact, case-sensitive strings (all tags here are uppercase or punctuation characters),\n  - with straight double quotes \" \" in CQL (no typographic quotes),\n  - no extra spaces or modifiers inside the quotes.\n  - This format is strict: [tag=\"NNS\"] works, [tag=\"nns\"] or [tag=\" NNS \"] does not.\n- You can combine conditions with other attributes, e.g. [word=\"people\" & tag=\"NNS\"].\n- Punctuation tags:\n  - Many punctuation tags are the punctuation character itself (e.g. \",\" or \"(\") and must be quoted literally in CQL:\n    - comma: [tag=\",\"]\n    - left bracket: [tag=\"(\"]\n    - right bracket: [tag=\")\"]\n    - currency symbol: [tag=\"$\"]\n    - hash: [tag=\"#\"]\n    - colon/dash/etc.: [tag=\":\"]\n    - quote marks: [tag='\"'] for double quote, [tag=\"'\"] for single quote.\n- Sentence-final punctuation uses tag SENT:\n  - e.g. [tag=\"SENT\"] for ., !, ? (do not search [tag=\".\"] for sentence ends).\n- Empty tag:\n  - Tokens that are HTML or other entities in angle brackets have no POS tag.\n  - In CQL, use [tag=\"\"] to find such tokens.\n- Special composite tag:\n  - IN/that is a literal tag value for \u201cthat\u201d as subordinator; use [tag=\"IN/that\"].\n- Tag values can be searched with regex on tag if supported, e.g. [tag=\"NN.*\"] to find all noun tags, but literal values must still match exactly when not using regex metacharacters.\n\n\nthe tagset\n----------\n(Include both punctuation/other symbols and POS tags.)\n\n(empty tag): HTML and other entities in angle brackets; token has no POS tag, use [tag=\"\"].\n\n\" or ' (tag is the quote character itself): single or double quotation marks; [tag='\"'] for \" and [tag=\"'\"] for '.\n\n( : left brackets; tag is \"(\", covers ( [ {.\n\n) : right brackets; tag is \")\", covers ) ] }.\n\n, : comma; tag is \",\".\n\n$ : currency symbols; tag is \"$\", covers $, \u00a3, \u20ac.\n\n# : hash (number sign); tag is \"#\".\n\n: : tag for various separators; covers dashes, ellipsis, underscore, (semi)colon: - \u2026 .. _ ;

each character position has a specific meaning depending on the POS.\n- Tag format is strict: each position must contain exactly one of the allowed values for that POS. To search flexibly, use regular-expression wildcards in CQL rather than changing the order/number of characters.\n- In CQL, use the `tag` attribute, e.g.:\n  - `[tag=\"N.FS.*\"]` matches feminine singular nouns: `N` at position 0 (noun), any value at position 1, `F` at position 2 (feminine), `S` at position 3 (singular), anything in remaining positions.\n  - `[tag=\"V..I.*\"]` matches verbs in the imperfect tense: `V` at position 0 (verb), any value at positions 1\u20132, `I` at position 3 (imperfect tense), anything in remaining positions.\n- Wildcards in CQL:\n  - `.` = any single character at that position.\n  - `.*` = any sequence (including empty) of characters from that position to the end of the tag.\n- Always use straight double quotes around tags in CQL: `[tag=\"...\"]`, not curly quotes.\n- Punctuation tags are non-positional fixed strings like `Fd`, `Fc`, `Fp` etc.;
